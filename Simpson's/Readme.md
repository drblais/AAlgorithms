# Simpson's Algorithm  
This Algorithms uses Simpson's rule to approximate the value of a function.  
It will switch to trapezoid rule if it needs to, in order to complete approximation.  
### Inputs  
x = the vector of equally spaced independent variable  
y = the vector of function values with respect to x  
### Outputs:  
I = the numerical integral calculated
